1 - user can update a flash card

  ###If a user deletes all the cards, there is an empty set.  How to deal with this?  Just an alert?  If there are no cards in the card array then don't display the set?


6 - create a table so that user can see, edit, or delete their cards or the whole set.



QUESTIONS -


* Eventually, I want users to only see the cards they create, plus maybe a generalized starter set of ones that are available to all as a sample.  How do I best set myself up for this.
