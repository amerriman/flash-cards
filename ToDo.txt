1 - When creating cards - make them appear through routes, not with jQuery?  Make sure this is cleared out as soon as the review begins AND/OR when the user goes home or to the cardset page.
2 - keep the intro screen and the cardset screen the same? I say yes, for now.





QUESTIONS -



* Eventually, I want users to only see the cards they create, plus maybe a generalized starter set of ones that are available to all as a sample.  How do I best set myself up for this.
