Need to deal with showing and hiding...
  #create-cardset-title (creates the title)
  #create-cards-container (creating the cards - I thought this was dealt with)
  #begin-review-area - the div that holds the begin review button at the bottom of the create cards page -maybe just put this in with the list cards table

1 - user can update a flash card (do this through jQuery)

  ###If a user deletes all the cards, there is an empty set.  How to deal with this?  Just an alert?  If there are no cards in the card array then don't display the set?




3 - Make it so the user can't delete the seeded sets

4 - add images to the sets in the database - a link to an image maybe?

5 - create new way of displaying the cardsets?  Or just modify it?

6 - create a table so that user can see, edit, or delete their cards or the whole set.




QUESTIONS -



* Eventually, I want users to only see the cards they create, plus maybe a generalized starter set of ones that are available to all as a sample.  How do I best set myself up for this.
