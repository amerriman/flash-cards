??????Why does the navbar color not change when I reset it to the correct color?

//make it possible for people to remove a cardset

//Make a progress bar that functions


//STRETCH add a way to shuffle them all - until then, make them radio buttons


//refactor for real OOP

//make it so they can't create two cardsets with the same name

//refactor so it pieces are located on different parts of the page

//refactor so cards can be edited. (show them in the table, make it so user can click on questions or answer and modify, or add new ones.)

less JQuesry??



---If modular, make a whole section that is the adding of the games etc.  Make just the add a cardset with title, then make a div that's the add card form all in a box with the title and the appending of the games.  Then near the title make a button to delete the whole review set.  Users can create a whole mess of card sets at once.  Look at Amber's code for this.  Then can just hide the whole section and not have to deal with all the little pieces.  If all the bits are in their own section, then that would be cleaner.

!!!!!!!!!  function removeCard(thingtoremove){
  delete object[thingtoremove];
}
